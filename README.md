## üìñ About The Project

ARGO is a global array of thousands of robotic floats that measure temperature and salinity in the world's oceans, providing a treasure trove of data for climate science. However, accessing this data requires specialized knowledge of programming and complex file formats, creating a high barrier for students, policymakers, and even many researchers.

FloatChat solves this problem by providing an intuitive conversational interface. It replaces the need for code with simple, plain-English questions, allowing anyone to explore this vital dataset and get back instant, interactive visualizations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

    üí¨ Conversational Interface: Ask questions in natural language, just like talking to a person.

    ü§ñ AI-Powered NLU: Utilizes a Natural Language Understanding model to accurately interpret user intent and extract key details.

    üìä On-the-Fly Visualization: Generates rich, interactive Plotly charts and maps in real-time in response to queries.

    üíª Zero-Code Access: No programming knowledge is required to explore the data, democratizing access to scientific insights.
